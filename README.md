# Yolov7 on Custom Dataset

1. Dataset 

For this project was used dataset from site https://www.vicos.si/resources/dfg/. This annotated dataset consists of 199 traffic sign categories captured in Slovenian roads. There are both ordinary photos of roads and augmented images. Additional augmentation dataset was created by inserting cropped instances of traffic signs. Due to the large amount of data and technical limitations, it was not possible to use all of them.
 
2. Сhoosing a model 

I chose model YOLOv7 my project. It is the fastest and most accurate real-time object detection model for computer vision tasks. The official paper demonstrates how this improved architecture surpasses all previous YOLO versions — as well as all other object detection models — in terms of both speed and accuracy on the MS COCO dataset.
